# Analysing-Employee-s-Performance-for-HR-Analytics

Project Description :

This project will train you how to use SQL to analyze a real-world database, how to extract the most useful information from the dataset, how to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance, and how to use a structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database.

Dataset : Uncleaned_employees_final_dataset.csv
